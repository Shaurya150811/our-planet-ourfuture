      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p id="about-me">Hi There! I'm Shaurya. Born in Mumbai, India, I am a boy who just turned 10 years old 2 months ago. I love coding, solving puzzles, playing football and video games.
        I believe writing is a powerful medium which can inspire people to the greatest extent. I have written a few blogs on sustainable living (below). A term which I think is very wide and can really save our planet.

<h3 class="sad"> <u>Do Not Waste Water:</u> </h3>
<h4 class="ok">Water is a natural but fast depleting resource that is required by everyone and will be required by generations to come. By being conscious of how we use it and how we can conserve water, we can make a huge difference. All it takes is a few simple steps in our day to day lives like: use less water to bathe, use washing machine and dishwashers only when the load is full (this will help in saving energy consumption too), try rain water harvesting etc.</h4>
<br><br>
<h3 class="sad"> <u>REDUCE ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION/SWITCH TO GREEN ENERGY:</u> </h3>
<h4 class="ok">This one comes as a no-brainer. Reducing the electricity consumption or switching to a green energy source is not only great for the environment, but also for your pockets. If you cannot immediately switch to a greener energy source, start using LED lights, turn off when not in need, make the best use of sunlight whenever possible and insulate your homes well.</h4>
<br><br>  
<h3 class="sad"> <u>DO NOT WASTE FOOD/GROW YOUR OWN PRODUCE:</u> </h3>
<h4 class="ok">There are millions in the world who go to sleep with their tummies empty. The ones that are blessed with food on their tables, should be wise to make sure no food is wasted at all. When eating out, order only what you can consume. And who said the backyards are only for playing? Grow some of your own produce – it’s also very calming and satisfying to see your own food grow!</h4>
<br><br> 
<h3 class="sad"> <u>USE ECO FRIENDLY/SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS:</u> </h3>
<h4 class="ok">When going for picnics or taking out food, only use eco-friendly disposables. There are so many great options available now, that can help reduce our waste considerably.</h4>
<br><br>  
<h3 class="sad"> <u>USE PUBLIC TRANSPORT/CYCLE/WALK:</u> </h3>
<h4 class="ok">If you can make the journey by walking or on cycle or public transport, instead of using your own cars; that is the best way to cut on several things like: carbon footprint, fuel consumption, pollution and of course cost! Moreover, if you walk or cycle, your body gets to exercise, so it’s a win-win situation.</h4>
<br><br>  
<h3 class="sad"> <u>BUY ONLY WHAT YOU NEED:</u> </h3>
<h4 class="ok">This is another major contributor to wasted resources and carbon footprint. How many times have you bought something and then never used it? Clothes in your wardrobes with tags still intact, and you have nothing to wear? Sounds familiar? Impulse buying is something that we should completely avoid doing. Think not once or twice but thrice before buying – “Do I really need it?”. You will soon realize how much money you can save by doing so.</h4>
<br><br>  
<h3 class="sad"> <u>ELIMINATE PLASTICS FROM YOUR LIFE:</u> </h3>
<h4 class="ok">Plastic pollution is having a seriously negative impact on our oceans and wildlife. An average human being produces about 250 grams of plastic waste every day!! That’s a BIG number. We can simply eliminate plastic from our lives by simple ways like: carry your own water bottles and lunch, buy loose grocery, use your own shopping bag.</h4>
<br><br> 
<h3 class="sad"> <u>DON’T THROW AWAY – FIX, DONATE OR REUSE:</u> </h3>
<h4 class="ok">Fixing or repairing things is much better for the environment, as compared to tossing them in the bin. If you have something that you no longer want, instead of throwing them away either give it to friends/family or donate to a charity or you could find an alternate use for it or even upcycle it to make something new! There are several awesome ways of upcycling clothes and creating stunning, new pieces. We will discuss about this in a separate post soon.</h4>
<br><br> 
<h3 class="sad"> <u>RECYCLE/UPCYCLE:</u> </h3>
<h4 class="ok">Always try to recycle the stuff that can be recycled. And when you no longer need an item, try to upcycle it by turning it into something useful. For example, old tshirts can be upcycled to make yarn, which can be used to make rugs or an old skirt can be refashioned by adding some embellishments. Old furniture can be upcycled to give a completely new look. There are several innovative ways of upcycling things, thus extending their life and saving them from ending up in the landfill.</h4>
<br><br> 
<h4 id="angry">So, as we see, all it takes is some consideration and thoughtfulness and we can easily live a sustainable life. We just need to implement these small changes in our habits and we can together make a big difference!</h4>
